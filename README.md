# Unicode to Character Converter
This script allows you to convert Unicode numbers to their corresponding characters. It handles input validation and exits upon user request.

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone the repository or download the Python script.
     `git clone https://github.com/GShreekar/Num-to-Char.git`
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
     `cd Num-to-Char`
   - Run the script using Python:
     `python Num-to-Char.py`
2. **Input**
   - Enter a Unicode number when prompted. 
   - To exit the program, type `exit`.
3. **Output**
   - The script will display the Unicode character corresponding to the entered number.
   - Errors are handled for invalid input and out-of-range Unicode numbers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Further Development
- **GUI interface for easier interaction:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly way to input Unicode numbers and view their corresponding characters.
